Content: similarity laws for stressing heated wings . similarity laws for stressing heated wings . it will be shown that the differential equations for a heated plate with large temperature gradient and for a similar plate at constant temperature can be made the same by a proper modification of the thickness and the loading for the isothermal plate . this fact leads to the result that the stresses in the heated plate can be calculated from measured strains on the unheated plate by a series of relations, called the /similarity laws ./  the application of this analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamic heating is discussed in detail .  the loading on the unheated analog wing is, however, complicated and involves the novel concept of feedback and /body force/ loading .  the problem of stressing a heated box-wing structure can be solved by the same analog method and is briefly discussed .

Content: scale models for thermo-aeroelastic research . scale models for thermo-aeroelastic research . an investigation is made of the parameters to be satisfied for thermo-aeroelastic similarity .  it is concluded that complete similarity obtains only when aircraft and model are identical in all respects, including size . by limiting consideration to conduction effects, by assuming the major load carrying parts of the structure are in regions where the flow is either entirely laminar, or entirely turbulent, and by assuming a specific relationship between reynolds number and nusselt number, an approach to similarity can be achieved for small scale models . experimental and analytical work is required to check on the validity of these assumptions . it appears that existing hot wind tunnels will not be completely adequate for thermo-aeroelastic work, and accordingly a possible layout for the type of tunnel required is described . automatic programmed control of the tunnel would appear to be necessary .
